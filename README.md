 Cypress Automation Project: Affiliate Registration 
 
 Project Overview

This project is an automated test suite using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to test the affiliate registration process on the Tutorials Ninja demo website. The test script automates the following:

1. Logging into the website.
2. Navigating to the affiliate registration page.
3. Filling out the affiliate registration form.
4. Submitting the form and verifying successful registration.

The project uses the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to separate logic for each page, making the tests easier to maintain and reuse.

 Tools and Technologies Used

- Cypress - End-to-end testing framework.
- JavaScript- Scripting language for automation.
- Page Object Model (POM) - A design pattern to organize the test scripts.
- Node.js - JavaScript runtime for executing Cypress.

  videos/                           // Test execution videos (if enabled)


- **`affiliateRegistration.spec.js`** - The main test script that automates the affiliate registration flow.
- **`pageObjects/`** - This directory contains all the Page Object files, where each file represents a different web page involved in the test.
- **`screenshots/`** - Screenshots captured during test execution.
- **`videos/`** - Videos of the test runs (if configured).

## Running Screenshots and Videos

This project also captures screenshots and videos of the tests:

1. Screenshots:
   Screenshots are automatically taken at key points in the test using the `cy.screenshot()` command. They will be saved in the `cypress/screenshots/` directory.

2. Videos:
   Videos are recorded during the execution of tests if you run them in headless mode (`npx cypress run`). These videos will be stored in the `cypress/videos/` directory.
